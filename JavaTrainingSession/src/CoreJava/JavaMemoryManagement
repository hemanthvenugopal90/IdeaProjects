*****************JAVA MEMORY MANAGEMENT**************
a) Java Memory Management is usually done by JVM(java virtual machine).

b) Java memory management is divided into two major parts
    1. Stack Memory 2. Heap Memory

eg: public class test{
int a,b;
psvm()
{
Test t1 = new test(); - //new test();-object , t1 -> Referrence Variable
Static int age;

public void m1(){
int x=10; //local variable
}

public void m2(){
int y=20; //local variable
}

public void m3(){
int z=30; //local variable
}
}

      ______________                                               _________
     | int a ,int b |                                             |   t1    | <- reference variable also would be stored in the stack
     |              |                                             |_________|
     |              |                                              _________
     |              |                         Deallocating     -->| m3,x= 30|    <-- Allocating
     |              |                                             |_________|
     |              |                                              _________
     |              |                         Deallocating     -->| m2, y=20|    <-- Allocating     (Methods and Local Variables)
     |              |                                             |_________|
     |              |                                              _________
     |              |                                             |m1, x=10 |
     |              |                        Deallocating     -->|_________|    <-- Allocating
     |______________|

     ____________________
     | METASPACE         |
     |static int age=0;  |
     |Static void methods|
     |-----------------  |

1. Stack Memory (LIFO - Last in First out Concept)
Here the reference variable all the non static Methods local variables of non static methods will be Auto allocated and deallocated in LIFO manner
Once they are called the last variable to be allocated will first be destroyed like m3 -->m2-->m1.

2. Heap Memory
   In the Heap memory whatever the class instance variable we have like int a, int b will be stored over here
   ANd in the metaspace we have static variables and static void methods.

Interview Question - Difference between Stack Memory and Heap Memory

                                    STACK                                                HEAP
1. Storage                     Methods/ Local Variable/ references           Newly created objects
2. Order                       LIFO (Last in first out)                    complex mechanism like eden, survivor 1/2,Garbage collector
3. Life                        Current Method                              Maintained throughout the application/program
4. Efficiency                   Faster than heap                            Slower than Stack
5.Allocation/Deallocation        Automatic allocation - Whenever a method    created objects - allocation
                                  is called / returned                        Deallocation -> Garbage collector -> destroys objects when there is no reference or Null reference.
