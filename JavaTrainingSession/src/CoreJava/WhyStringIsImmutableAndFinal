Why String is immutable and Final in Java?

1. String Pool in Java

2.Security

3. Class Loading Mechanism

4. Optimization and performance

5. integer,long,doublke,float - Wrapper Classes - immutable and final.

The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading.
The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability and to not allow others to extend it.
The String objects are cached in the String pool, and it makes the String immutable.


Below are a few advantages of an immutable class:
String Pool Requirement. String pool is a specific storage area for string objects. ...
Caching KEY. Since a string object is immutable, its hashcode is cached at the time of creation so that it can be used multiple times without calculation. ...
Security. ...
Thread-safe.


Because java uses the concept of string literal. Suppose there are 5 reference variables,all referes to one object "sachin".
If one reference variable changes the value of the object, it will be affected to all the reference variables. That is why string objects are immutable in java.
